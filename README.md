# Everett Enterprises AWS Migration Project

## Overview
This project aims to assist Everett Enterprises, a marketing agency, in migrating their on-premises infrastructure to the AWS cloud. The goal is to design a fast, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solution using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices.

## Project Objectives
- Create a multi-tier architecture in AWS utilizing Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform).
- Implement CI/CD pipelines (CodePipeline) for real-time updates to the infrastructure.
- Develop a visual presentation with network diagrams/architecture.
- Establish a Jira Dashboard and Roadmap to track team tasks, organization, and progress through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Project Components
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize Terraform to define and provision AWS resources programmatically.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Implement CodePipeline for automated building, testing, and deployment of infrastructure changes.
- **Presentation:** Create a visual representation of the architecture with detailed network diagrams.
- **Jira Dashboard:** Set up a Jira Dashboard and Roadmap to manage and monitor team tasks and progress.

## Project Steps
1. Analyze the existing on-premises infrastructure.
2. Design and implement the multi-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform.
3. Set up CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline for automated updates.
4. Develop a visual presentation illustrating the architecture and migration plan.
5. Create a Jira Dashboard and Roadmap to track tasks and team progress.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the respective folders for Terraform code and CI/CD configurations.
3. Follow the instructions in each directory's README for detailed setup and execution steps.
4. Use Jira Dashboard to monitor progress and manage tasks.
